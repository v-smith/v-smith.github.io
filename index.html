						 <p> <strong>Hello and welcome to my website! Thank you for visiting! </strong> My name is Vicky and I am a PhD student at University College London.
						 My current research is focused on extracting <strong> Pharmacokinetic Data </strong>from <strong>tables</strong>  and <strong>free text</strong> in <strong>Scietific Literature</strong> and using this
						 extracted data to <strong>predict Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Drug-Drug Interactions</strong>. This project is helping me to build on my skillset in <strong>text mining, natural language processing (NLP),
						 machine learning and statistical data science</strong>.
						 </p>

						 <p>
						 <strong>I am passionate about health</strong> and how machine learning and data science can be exploited to <strong>improve health
						 outcomes</strong>. My career aspiration is to make an impact in health by <strong>building computational models</strong> which allow better decisions to be
						 made, across drug development, clinical trials and in the clinic, to benefit both patients and health professionals.
						 </p>

						 <p>
						 After completing an <strong>MSci in Neuroscience</strong> at UCL, I joined a large telco company on their <strong>Technology Graduate Scheme</strong> where I became exposed to software
						 development, big data and machine learning. However, I was keen to apply this knowledge to health</strong>, and learn more about the complexities of health data science
						 and so I decided to return to UCL to join the <strong>AI Enabled Healthcare CDT</strong>. Now, I am enjoying building upon my <strong>mutlidisciplinary knowledge</strong> at the interface of health and technology, in this exciting and fast moving space.
						 </p>

						 <p>
						 In my spare time <strong>I enjoy sport</strong> (you may find me cycling, bouldering, running, hiking), <strong>I'm a foody</strong> (you may find me trying new cuisines, doing culinary workshops or cooking up a storm) and <strong>I love to travel</strong> (look out for me at Peru Rainbow Moutain, the Faroe Islands or the Vineyards of the Rhine Valley...all on the list to visit next)!
						 </p>

						 <p>
						 Please explore my <strong>previous work below</strong>  that I have completed in my time as an MSci and MRes student.

								<h3><a href="images/MRes_Project_Final.pdf" download= "MRes_Project_Final.pdf"> An Automated Approach for Identifying and
								Categorising Tables in Pharmacokinetic Literature </a></h3>
								<p>Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models estimate parameters to quan-
								tify the time course and effect of drugs. PKPD models are used to establish
								which drug candidates and dosing schedules will yield optimum efficacy and safety,
								throughout clinical trials and in the clinic. Prior information from similar drug
								compounds is used to make preclinical PKPD parameters predictions. However,
								large amounts of high-quality prior data are locked away in tables in the litera-
								ture. Hence, this research focused on the initial stage of
								automated table data extraction, classifying tables reported in PK literature by the
								parameters and covariates they contain. Table text is encoded into embedding ma-
								trices to provide input to a supervised machine learning pipeline. This pipeline will aid researchers to efficiently
								filter usable PK estimates and provides the initial step towards automated table
								data extraction.

								<h3><a href="images/MM_dissertation.pdf" download= "MM_dissertation.pdf">Classifiying Mammographic Masses with Supervised Machine Learning Methods </a></h3>
								<p>Breast Cancer, one of the most diagnosed life-threatening cancers for women, affects 1 in 8
									women in their lifetime. Detecting breast cancer in the early stages of the disease is a key to
									increasing survival chance.Various data sets have been made available, to encourage development of methods to improve
									accuracy and speed of diagnosis. The UCI Mammographic Mass data set contains 961 instances
									of mammographic mass data, with 516 benign and 445 malignant instances collected from
									full field mammograms. In this work, a Decision Tree Classifier and Adaboost Classifiers are applied to this dataset to classify mamographic masses as maligant or benign based on their attributes and compared to previous works using Machine Learning techniques on the same data set.

								<h3><a href="images/MSci_Final_dissertation.pdf" download="MSci_Final_dissertation.pdf">Characterising Microglia in App Knock-in Mouse Models of Alzheimer’s Disease</a></h3>
								<p>Transgenic models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) overexpressing amyloid precursor protein
								(APP) have been criticised for generating artefactual results and held accountable for limited
								success in translating results from mouse studies to human AD clinical trials. The recent
								publications of App knock-in (App-KI) models, containing combinations of human familial
								Swedish (NL), Arctic (G) and Beyreuther-Iberian (F) mutations, offer improved models.
								Although microglia are emerging as a key player in human AD from both GWAS and animal
								studies, the microglial phenotype of these App-KIs is not well understood. Consequently, this
								research aimed to assess microglial numbers, activation status and gene expression in the AppKI models,
								to understand how their phenotype reflects human disease progression.
